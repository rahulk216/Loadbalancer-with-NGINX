* Request is made to a NGINX server .
* NGNIX makes a request to web server which responds by sedning the content to NGINX
* NGINX sends a response to Frontend .
* technical term : REVERSE PROXY
* Used when multiple servers are used : basically when we have a huge traffic
* NGINX acts a load balancer
* NGINX forwards the request from frontend to a server available .
* another usecase would be for Encryption : Basically rather than Encrypting each server we can encrypt just the main NGINX server.
